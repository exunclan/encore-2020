# Boye

We see that it's an extremely light binary, probably written directly in assembly.

It's a special kind of ROP vulnerability called [SIGROP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigreturn-oriented_programming), and pwntools has [built in support for sending sigframes](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/rop/srop.html) as well.

Using [ROPgadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget), we find the addresses of the important gadgets we'll use in the exploit.

## Important addresses

```
0x400180 -> sigrop
0x400185 -> syscall
0x4001ca -> /bin/sh
```
